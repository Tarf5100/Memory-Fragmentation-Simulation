# Memory-Fragmentation-Simulation-
This project simulates memory management using a fixed-size partition scheme. It supports memory allocation (First-Fit, Best-Fit, Worst-Fit), deallocation, and generates status reports. The program calculates internal fragmentation and provides a detailed overview of memory blocks and process allocation.
